<p>His last album sold 2.5 million around the world and nestles in the record collections of Barack Obama and former French leader Nicolas Sarkozy.
He has also been hailed as 'the philosopher king' of European club music, with his 2010 global hit Alors On Danse being remixed by Kanye West.
But, despite selling more records in France in the past year than local heroes Daft Punk, 29-year-old Belgian singer-songwriter Paul Van Haver – aka Stromae – is virtually unknown over here.
That could soon change, though, as the French-speaking maverick from the backstreets of Brussels prepares for a new UK single, Tous Les Mêmes, and a British unveiling of his all-conquering Racine Carrée (Square Root) album.

Stromae, whose stage name re-arranges the two syllables of the word 'maestro', isn't easy to pin down. He started his career on the Brussels rap underground, but has since adopted a more mainstream outlook. His infectious songs combine pop hooks, Nineties electronics, doo-wop harmonies and Afro-tinged rhythms. And, with thoughtful, often melancholy lyrics that aren't afraid to tackle big issues, his music has a melodramatic flavour.
As he proved during a recent run of concerts in Paris, he is also a consummate showman. Playing to huge crowds that included fashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier and rapper Mos Def, the dapper singer delivered some outstanding visuals complete with high-art animations, costume changes and dance moves worthy of Justin Timberlake.
A natural raconteur, he even found time for some self-deprecating jokes about Belgium being a tiny nation sandwiched between big brothers France and Holland. But, with his country's football team dark horses for this summer's World Cup in Brazil (with an official anthem sung by Stromae), that particular boot might soon be on the other foot.
But can a Belgian become a star in the UK singing in French? Chatting after his Paris show, Stromae cited the legendary Edith Piaf as an artist who garnered global acclaim while performing in her mother tongue. He added that it won't feel right to perform in English until he had spent more time here.
On the evidence of Racine Carrée, the singer, the son of a Flemish mother and a Rwandan father, has the talent to overcome the language barrier. Among the record's high points are Papaoutai and Formidable. The video for the latter, a song that casts Stromae as a lovelorn drunkard, has been watched 77 million times on YouTube.
Despite the old standing joke that it is impossible to come up with five famous Belgians, the name of Stromae could soon be added to a roll call that includes cyclist Eddy Merckx, TinTin creator Herge, the painters Rubens and Magritte and saxophone inventor Adolphe Sax.

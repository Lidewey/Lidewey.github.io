title: What is Three-ME
---

Three-ME (Multi-sector Macroeconomic Model for the Evaluation of Environmental 
and Energy policy) is a new model of the French economy developed by ADEME, OFCE and 
IVM.  Its main purpose is to evaluate the medium and long term impact of environmental and energy policy measures on the economy at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. To do so, Three-ME combines two important features. Firstly, it has the main characteristics of neo-Keynesian models by assuming a slow adjustment of effective quantities and prices to their notional level. Compared to standard multi-sectors CGEM, this has the advantage to allow for the existence of under-optimum equilibriums such as the presence of involuntary unemployment. Secondly, production and consumption structures are represented with a generalized CES function which allows for the elasticity of substitution to differ between each couple of inputs or goods.  This is an improvement compared to the standard approach that uses nested CES functions which has the disadvantage to impose a common elasticity of substitution between the goods located in two different nested structures.

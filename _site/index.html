<h2>What is Three-ME</h2>
<small>
<p>Three-ME (Multi-sector Macroeconomic Model for the Evaluation of Environmental 
and Energy policy) is a new model of the French economy developed by ADEME, OFCE and 
IVM. This new model is an improved version of the previous model (Callonnec et al., 2011; Reynes et al. 2011). Its main purpose is to evaluate the medium and long term impact of environmental and energy policy measures on the economy at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. To do so, Three-ME combines two important features. Firstly, it has the main characteristics of neo-Keynesian models by assuming a slow adjustment of effective quantities and prices to their notional level, an endogenous money supply, a Taylor rule and a Philips curve. Compared to standard multi-sector CGEMs, this has the advantage to allow for the existence of under-optimum equilibriums such as the presence of involuntary unemployment. <!-- The following part till "secondly" is not part of the abstract anymore. --> <!-- However, this effort seems to have a cost in terms of the dissagregation level which is often limited. This is typically the case for currently running macroeconomic models for the French economy: e.g. MESANGE of the French ministry of Economy has three sectors (Allerd-Prigent et al., 2002), E-Mod of the OFCE (Chauvin et al., 2002) and MASCOTTE of the French central bank (Baghli et al., 2004) have only one. However, earlier versions of these models in the 1980's and 1990's had a higher level of dissagregation, between 6 and 8 products (see Economie et Prévision, 1998). But still, neo-Keynesian macroeconomic models generally do not distinguish between the different types of energy or of transport which are particularly important for the assessment of environmental and energy policy. They are thus likely to neglect the effect of activity transfers in terms of growth and employment from high to low intensive energy setors. <br> A second limit particularly important for the analysis of the economic impact of environmental and energy policy is that CGEM provide insufficient reprentation of endogenous energy efficiency phenomena. For instance, households consomption behaviors are generally represented through a nested structure of utility functions which defines a simple correlation between the level of consumption of each good and the revenue. The model does not include saturation point in the consumption of the households. The link between consumption and revenue leads to a 1% increase in the consumption of each good. To account for non-linearities, it is usual to introduce a Linear Expenditure System (LES) utility function. A LES specification assumes that a share of the base year consumtion is incompressible and therefore the relation between income and consumption is not linear anymore. This specification allows for the distinction between consumption of necessity and luxurious goods. --> Secondly, <!-- Secondly, Three-ME is a hybrid model in the sense that it combines the top-down approach of general equilibrium macroeconomic models with elements of bottom-up models of energy models developed by engineers. As in bottom-up models, the amount of energy consumed is related to their use, that is the number of buildings and cars,a nd the energy class to which they belong. This hypothesis is more realistic compared to the assumption made in the majority of of top-down models where energy consumption is usually directly related to income through a nested structure of utility function.   --> production and consumption structures are represented with a generalized CES function which allows for the elasticity of substitution to differ between each couple of inputs or goods.  This is an improvement compared to the standard approach that uses nested CES functions which has the disadvantage to impose a common elasticity of substitution between the goods located in two different nested structures. <br>
</p>
<p>Compared to the previous version of the model<!-- (Callonnec et al., 2011; Reynes et al. 2011) -->, the following important improvements were made:
<ul>
<li>
 The 4 energy sectors of the previous version (coal, petroleum, electricity and gas) have been subdivided into 13 sectors in order to better account for the impact of renewable energy.</li>
<li> The model now distinguishes commodities from activities: the number of activities is not equal to the number of commodities and each activity can potentially produce any commodity. This is typically the case for energy sectors that may produce the same commodity.  For instance, the commodity electricity is produced by several activities: nuclear, wind, solar, etc. Another example is the activity agriculture that produces several commodities: agriculture product, food, biofuel and biogas. </li>
<li>Because of access restrictions to National account investment data, investment decisions were modeled for all of the private sector. We now use detailed investment data disaggregated by sector and therefore identify a specific investment pattern for each activity.</li>
<li> The modeling of households’ behaviors has been improved. The number of households has increased from 1 to 5, classified by quantile of revenue. In the previous version, only 2 energy classes (efficient and other) for buildings and cars were distinguished. The new verison includes 7 energy classes for buildings and cars that follows the standard A to G classification. The link between energy consumption and stock was rather <i>ad hoc</i>, since we assumed a loglinear negative correlation between energy consumption and the share of the efficient stock. The level of energy consumption (and thus of CO2 emissions) is now directly related to the type of buildings or cars and is also expressed in physical units. Finally, the arbitrage between the different classes of investments is not directly a function of price of energy, but of the relative user cost of each investment which includes the expected energy related costs.</li>
</ul>
Three-ME model is programmed on the E-views 7 package software and simulated with 
the Broyden algorithm.

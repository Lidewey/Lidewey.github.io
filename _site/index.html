 <p> Three-ME (Multi-sector Macroeconomic Model for the Evaluation of Environmental 
and Energy policy) is a new model of the French economy developed by ADEME, OFCE and 
TNO. This new model is an improved version of the previous model (Callonnec et al., 2011; Reynes et al. 2011). Its main purpose is to evaluate the medium and long term impact of environmental and energy policy measured on the economy at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. To do so, Three-ME combines two important features. Firstly, it has the main characteristics of neo-Keynesian models by assuming a slow adjustment of effective quantities and prices to their notional level, an endogenous money supply, a Taylor rule and a Philips curve. Compared to standard multi-sector CGEMs, this has the advantage to allow for the existence of under-optimum equilibriums such as the presence of involuntary unemployment. Secondly, production and consumption structures are represented with a generalized CES function which allows for the elasticity of substitution to differ between each couple of inputs or goods.  This is an improvement compared to the standard approach that uses nested CES functions which has the disadvantage to impose a common elasticity of substitution between the goods located in two different nested structures. <br>
</p>
<p>Compared to the previous version of the model, the following important improvements were made:
<li>The 4 energy sectors of the previous version (coal, petroleum, electricity and gas) have been subdivided into 13 sectors in order to better account for the impact of renewable energy.</li><br>
<li> The model now distinguishes commodities from activities: the number of activities is not equal to the number of commodities and each activity can potentially produce any commodity. This is typically the case for energy sectors that may produce the same commodity.  For instance, the commodity electricity is produced by several activities: nuclear, wind, solar, etc. Another example is the activity agriculture that produces several commodities: agriculture product, food, biofuel and biogas. </li><br>
<li>Because of access restrictions to National account investment data, investment decisions were modeled for all of the private sector. We now use detailed investment data disaggregated by sector and therefore identify a specific investment pattern for each activity.</li><br>
<li> The modeling of households' behaviors has been improved. The number of households has increased from 1 to 5, classified by quantile of revenue. In the previous version, only 2 energy classes (efficient and other) for buildings and cars were distinguished. The new verison includes 7 energy classes for buildings and cars that follows the standard A to G classification. The link between energy consumption and stock was rather <i>ad hoc</i>, since we assumed a loglinear negative correlation between energy consumption and the share of the efficient stock. The level of energy consumption (and thus of CO2 emissions) is now directly related to the type of buildings or cars and is also expressed in physical units. Finally, the arbitrage between the different classes of investments is not directly a function of price of energy, but of the relative user cost of each investment which includes the expected energy related costs.</li><br>

Three-ME model is programmed on the E-views 7 package software and simulated with 
the Broyden algorithm. <br><br>

</p>

<p>Climate change is becoming a serious problem and therefore an important subject to economic models. There are a number of policies that governments might consider in response to global warming. Three-ME is one of the most recently developed models that attempts to assess such policies and their effects. </p>
<p>
Three-ME is a multisectorial model which considers 24 production sectors and 17 energetic sub-sectors. Moreover, the model combines a top-down approach based on a neo-keynesian structure and bottom-up features in the modelling of consumption behavior. Therefore, this model is much more detailed and realistic than other existing models. </p>
<p>
During this workshop the economic effects of energy transition will be discussed on the basis of the Three-ME model. The workshop will continue discussing three intersting scenario’s that have been simulated by the ADEME regarding the nuclear share in the upcoming 10 and 30 years.

<p>Negawatt is an independent energy experts association that has produced a scenario in 2011 assessing a sustainable vision of the energy system. The analysis relies on other dimensions than just the nature of the energy system in France by encompassing demand-side issues. Sobriety, energy efficiency and development of renewables energies are the three main pilars that underpins this analysis. The study we conduct aimed to assess the economic impacts of such a scenario.</p>

<p>In order to evaluate medium and long term impacts of environmental and energy policy, measured on the economy at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels, models come to practice. However, existing models have limitations: they lack in details or realism and say little about the short and medium term. Model tools applied to climate change can be divided into, roughly speaking, the bottom-up approach and the top-down approach. However, each has its advantages and disadvantages.<br> <br>
This workshop reviews existing models concerning climate change and their commonly used model tools and continues an elaborate introduction of the Three-ME model. How is the general equilibrium ensured in this newly developed model and how does it combine the bottom-up approach and the top-down approach?
Furthermore, there will be a section dedicated to the simulations.

This workshop will be hosted by Dr. Gaël Callonnec (ADEME) and will concern a profound analysis of simulating the macro-economic effects of the energy transition in France. Dr. Gaël Callonnec will elaborate on the energy transition during the next 30 years and he will explain the economic effects of a carbon tax in France on the basis of the Three-ME model. Two ways for analysing the economic effects of an ecological measure will be discussed: the static equilibrium models and the models in general and dynamic equilibrium. In gereral equilibrium, the fight against global warming does not need to be costly if the government undertakes the right policies according to the results of Three-ME. Dr. Gaël Callonnec will employ his workshop explaining how the general equilibrium is ensured in the Three-ME model and what these government policies are. Furthermore, the results of the energetical transition will be covered.

<p>
Climate change becomes a more and more frequently mentioned topic as temperatures keep rising due to greenhouse gas emmissions. Several government policies have been implemented with the goal of reducing global warming: to keep global warming from rising more than 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels, developed countries are expected to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 80-95% by 2050 compared to 1990, the Kyoto protocol has been implemented and the EU has pledged to cut GHG emissions by 20% (18% now) by 2020. </p>
<p>In order to evaluate medium and long term impacts of environmental and energy policy measured on the economy at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels, models come to practice. Currently available (techno-economic modelling) tools have relevant limitations such as the difficulty to represent pervasive technological developments, the difficulty to represent non-linearities, thresholds and irreversibility, and the insufficiently developed representation of economic sectors with a significant potential for mitigation and resource efficiency. Dr. Frédéric Reynès (OFCE, TNO) and Gissela Landa (OFCE) will host this workshop by elaborating on existing models applied to climate change and the newly developed model “Three-Me” by Dr. Frédéric Reynès and his collegues. This workshop aims to explain the relevance of models and how to improve on them. An introduction to model tools will be given and general equilibrium models applied to economic, environmental and energy issues will be discussed. Other topics such as Bottom-Up approach, Top-down approach and CGEM will be reviewed. The second half of the workshop will be devoted to introducing the Three-ME model.

<p>The Energy Policy and Modelling Group will host an IEA-ETSAP funded international workshop on methodologies linking energy systems and economic models. The purpose of this workshop is to exchange experiences (methodologies and applications) on integrating energy systems models (with a particular focus on MARKAL and TIMES models) with economic models (with a particular focus on input-output and CGE models). The objective is to improve methodologies for providing feedback from energy systems model results to the economic drivers and for determining the economic impacts of different energy scenarios. The OFCE and the ADEME will facilitate the workshop on Thee-ME. <br>

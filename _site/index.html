 <p>Three-ME (Multi-sector Macroeconomic Model for the Evaluation of Environmental 
and Energy policy) is a new model of the French economy developed by ADEME, OFCE and 
TNO. This new model is an improved version of the previous model (Callonnec et al., 2011; Reynes et al. 2011). Its main purpose is to evaluate the medium and long term impact of environmental and energy policy measures on the economy at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. To do so, Three-ME combines two important features. Firstly, it has the main characteristics of neo-Keynesian models by assuming a slow adjustment of effective quantities and prices to their notional level, an endogenous money supply, a Taylor rule and a Philips curve. Compared to standard multi-sector CGEMs, this has the advantage to allow for the existence of under-optimum equilibriums such as the presence of involuntary unemployment. <!-- The following part till "secondly" is not part of the abstract anymore. --> <!-- However, this effort seems to have a cost in terms of the dissagregation level which is often limited. This is typically the case for currently running macroeconomic models for the French economy: e.g. MESANGE of the French ministry of Economy has three sectors (Allerd-Prigent et al., 2002), E-Mod of the OFCE (Chauvin et al., 2002) and MASCOTTE of the French central bank (Baghli et al., 2004) have only one. However, earlier versions of these models in the 1980's and 1990's had a higher level of dissagregation, between 6 and 8 products (see Economie et PrÃ©vision, 1998). But still, neo-Keynesian macroeconomic models generally do not distinguish between the different types of energy or of transport which are particularly important for the assessment of environmental and energy policy. They are thus likely to neglect the effect of activity transfers in terms of growth and employment from high to low intensive energy setors. <br> A second limit particularly important for the analysis of the economic impact of environmental and energy policy is that CGEM provide insufficient reprentation of endogenous energy efficiency phenomena. For instance, households consomption behaviors are generally represented through a nested structure of utility functions which defines a simple correlation between the level of consumption of each good and the revenue. The model does not include saturation point in the consumption of the households. The link between consumption and revenue leads to a 1% increase in the consumption of each good. To account for non-linearities, it is usual to introduce a Linear Expenditure System (LES) utility function. A LES specification assumes that a share of the base year consumtion is incompressible and therefore the relation between income and consumption is not linear anymore. This specification allows for the distinction between consumption of necessity and luxurious goods. --> Secondly, <!-- Secondly, Three-ME is a hybrid model in the sense that it combines the top-down approach of general equilibrium macroeconomic models with elements of bottom-up models of energy models developed by engineers. As in bottom-up models, the amount of energy consumed is related to their use, that is the number of buildings and cars,a nd the energy class to which they belong. This hypothesis is more realistic compared to the assumption made in the majority of of top-down models where energy consumption is usually directly related to income through a nested structure of utility function.   --> production and consumption structures are represented with a generalized CES function which allows for the elasticity of substitution to differ between each couple of inputs or goods.  This is an improvement compared to the standard approach that uses nested CES functions which has the disadvantage to impose a common elasticity of substitution between the goods located in two different nested structures. <br>
</p>
<p>Compared to the previous version of the model<!-- (Callonnec et al., 2011; Reynes et al. 2011) -->, the following important improvements were made:
<li>The 4 energy sectors of the previous version (coal, petroleum, electricity and gas) have been subdivided into 13 sectors in order to better account for the impact of renewable energy.</li><br>
<li> The model now distinguishes commodities from activities: the number of activities is not equal to the number of commodities and each activity can potentially produce any commodity. This is typically the case for energy sectors that may produce the same commodity.  For instance, the commodity electricity is produced by several activities: nuclear, wind, solar, etc. Another example is the activity agriculture that produces several commodities: agriculture product, food, biofuel and biogas. </li><br>
<li>Because of access restrictions to National account investment data, investment decisions were modeled for all of the private sector. We now use detailed investment data disaggregated by sector and therefore identify a specific investment pattern for each activity.</li><br>
<li> The modeling of households' behaviors has been improved. The number of households has increased from 1 to 5, classified by quantile of revenue. In the previous version, only 2 energy classes (efficient and other) for buildings and cars were distinguished. The new verison includes 7 energy classes for buildings and cars that follows the standard A to G classification. The link between energy consumption and stock was rather <i>ad hoc</i>, since we assumed a loglinear negative correlation between energy consumption and the share of the efficient stock. The level of energy consumption (and thus of CO2 emissions) is now directly related to the type of buildings or cars and is also expressed in physical units. Finally, the arbitrage between the different classes of investments is not directly a function of price of energy, but of the relative user cost of each investment which includes the expected energy related costs.</li><br>

Three-ME model is programmed on the E-views 7 package software and simulated with 
the Broyden algorithm. <br>

The overall structure of the model is schematized in <i><a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a></i>. In the short term, Three-ME has the main characteristics of a standard neo-Keynesian macroeconomic model of 
demand in an open economy. An important one is that demand determines supply. The 
demand is composed of (intermediate and final) consumption, investment and export whereas 
the supply comes from imports and the domestic production. As a feed-back with eventually 
some lags, the supply affects the demand through several mechanisms. The level of 
production determines the quantity of inputs used by the firms and thus the quantity of their 
intermediate consumptions and investment which are two components of the demand. It 
determines the level of employment as well and consequently the households’ final 
consumption. Another effect of employment on demand goes through the wage setting via the 
unemployment rate which is also determined by the active population. The active population 
is mainly determined by exogenous factors such as the demography but also by endogenous 
factors: because of discouraged worker effects, the unemployment rate may affect the labor 
participation rate and thus the active population.</p><br>

<a name="Figure_1">Figure 1</a>: Three-ME Model <br>
<img src="/images/threeme.jpg" alt="Three-ME" width="650" height="700">

<p>The unemployment rate is an important determinant of the wages dynamic which is 
defined by a Phillips curve. The inflationary property of the model is determined by the 
feedback loop between wages, production cost and prices. Prices are assumed to adjust slowly 
to their optimum level that corresponds to a mark-up over marginal costs. Consequently, 
wages, which affect production costs, affect directly prices. Prices have in return an impact on 
wages because of they are indexed on the consumer price. Production costs are also directly 
affected by prices via the cost of intermediate consumptions and of investment. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This dynamic between wages, cost and prices affects the demand through several 
canals. Wages affect the household consumption because they are an important part of their 
income. Prices and cost affect profits and thus sectors’ debts level. But they affect the 
households’ consumption and investment too because they finance a part of the private debt 
of the economy. Another canal is the monetary policy which is defined by a Taylor rule. The 
European central bank determines the interest rate level based on the European level of 
inflation and unemployment. This has an effect on the demand via the negative effect of the 
real interest rate on consumption and investment. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The dynamic of prices is the driver of the substitution mechanisms of the model. The 
evolution of relative prices between imported and domestic goods defines the repartition 
between imported and domestic products to satisfy the internal (consumption and 
investments) and external (export) demand. The evolution of relative prices between types of 
goods and services defines the structure of consumption of the economy. Importantly for the 
analysis of environmental and energy policies, it defines the share of each energy and 
transport into (intermediate and final) consumptions. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Three-ME explicitly distinguishes between five types of transports and four types of 
energy (resp. red and yellow lines in <i><a href="#Table1">Table 1</a></i>). Energy intensity was the main criterion for the 
selection of the 24 sectors <!-- (see Appendix C) -->. This relatively high level of disaggregation is 
important to capture the complexity of the substitution mechanisms involved after a change in 
the relative price between energies. For instance, an increase in the oil price tends to lead to 
substitution from oil to the other energy in several ways. In addition to direct substitutions by 
producer and consumer, indirect effects occur via the increase of the production price of oil 
intensive sectors. This leads to intermediate and final consumptions structure less oil 
intensive. The decrease of the use of transport by road would be the most typical example.</p><br> 
<a name="Table1">Table 1</a>: Sector disaggregation in Three-ME <br><br>
<img src="/images/Table1.jpg" alt="Three-ME" width="650" height="700"> <br><br>
<p>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Three-ME also accounts for endogenous energy efficiency and sobriety effects. In 
contrast with the substitution mechanisms, the reduction of a given energy consumption does 
not imply the increase of the use of another energy. Sobriety consists in refraining from 
consuming energy by for instance staying home during the weekend instead of taking the car 
or by lowering the heating temperature in the house. In general, sobriety leads to a decrease in 
the welfare of the consumer. In contrast, in the case of efficiency, the same welfare is 
achieved with a lower quantity of energy. Energy efficiency implies an investment in a more 
efficient technology by for instance switching from a high to a low oil consumption car or by 
using more efficient insulation techniques for the house. In the current version of model, endogenous efficiency phenomena are introduced through an explicit distinction between two 
types of housing and automobile investments: energy saving housing and “comfort” housing 
investments; low and high oil consumption cars.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In Three-ME, efficiency and sobriety phenomena decrease the consumer price since the 
share of energy into consumption decreases <!-- (see Section V ) -->. This allows for directly 9
capturing the so-called “rebound effect” in consumption behaviour often observed at the 
micro level (Bentzen, 2004; Sorrell and al., 2009). There is a rebound effect when the 
effective energy saving from an investment in energy efficiency is less than the energy saving 
expected ex ante because the consumer uses a part of the reduction of her energy bill to 
increase her energy consumption. A typical example is the case of certain poor households 
who live in badly insulated houses and set a low heating temperature to reduce their energy 
bill. After an insulation investment, they will have the tendency to increase the heating 
temperature of their house keeping their energy bill more or less constant. This effect is 
explicitly taken into account in the model: an energy efficiency investment decreases the 
consumer price and thus increases the real income which leads to a higher level of (energy) 
consumption. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The short and medium run dynamic is largely driven by the demand side through multiplier 
and accelerator mechanisms. Because of the slow adjustment of price and quantity to their 
optimal value, the allocation of production factors is sub-optimal in the short and medium run. 
The long term is driven by the supply constrain. All adjustment processes are achieved: there 
is no error of anticipation and the effective quantities coincide with the optimal ones. The 
prices are fully adjusted and all markets are in equilibrium. The unemployment reaches its 
structural level. The economy thus converges toward a stable equilibrium growth path à la 
Solow (1956) where all real variables grow at the same rate defined as the sum of the growth 
rates of the technical progress and of the population. Per capita real variables grow thus at the 
same rate as the technical progress. All prices grow at the rate of inflation which is defined by 
the exogenous rate of inflation in the rest of the world. The endogenous dynamic of the model 
is determined by capital accumulation of households and firms, the specification of the 
anticipation and of the adjustment dynamic.</p>

 <p>Three-ME (Multi-sector Macroeconomic Model for the Evaluation of Environmental 
and Energy policy) is a new model of the French economy developed by ADEME, OFCE and 
TNO. This new model is an improved version of the previous model (Callonnec et al., 2011; Reynes et al. 2011). Its main purpose is to evaluate the medium and long term impact of environmental and energy policy measures on the economy at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. To do so, Three-ME combines two important features. Firstly, it has the main characteristics of neo-Keynesian models by assuming a slow adjustment of effective quantities and prices to their notional level, an endogenous money supply, a Taylor rule and a Philips curve. Compared to standard multi-sector CGEMs, this has the advantage to allow for the existence of under-optimum equilibriums such as the presence of involuntary unemployment. <!-- The following part till "secondly" is not part of the abstract anymore. --> <!-- However, this effort seems to have a cost in terms of the dissagregation level which is often limited. This is typically the case for currently running macroeconomic models for the French economy: e.g. MESANGE of the French ministry of Economy has three sectors (Allerd-Prigent et al., 2002), E-Mod of the OFCE (Chauvin et al., 2002) and MASCOTTE of the French central bank (Baghli et al., 2004) have only one. However, earlier versions of these models in the 1980's and 1990's had a higher level of dissagregation, between 6 and 8 products (see Economie et PrÃ©vision, 1998). But still, neo-Keynesian macroeconomic models generally do not distinguish between the different types of energy or of transport which are particularly important for the assessment of environmental and energy policy. They are thus likely to neglect the effect of activity transfers in terms of growth and employment from high to low intensive energy setors. <br> A second limit particularly important for the analysis of the economic impact of environmental and energy policy is that CGEM provide insufficient reprentation of endogenous energy efficiency phenomena. For instance, households consomption behaviors are generally represented through a nested structure of utility functions which defines a simple correlation between the level of consumption of each good and the revenue. The model does not include saturation point in the consumption of the households. The link between consumption and revenue leads to a 1% increase in the consumption of each good. To account for non-linearities, it is usual to introduce a Linear Expenditure System (LES) utility function. A LES specification assumes that a share of the base year consumtion is incompressible and therefore the relation between income and consumption is not linear anymore. This specification allows for the distinction between consumption of necessity and luxurious goods. --> Secondly, <!-- Secondly, Three-ME is a hybrid model in the sense that it combines the top-down approach of general equilibrium macroeconomic models with elements of bottom-up models of energy models developed by engineers. As in bottom-up models, the amount of energy consumed is related to their use, that is the number of buildings and cars,a nd the energy class to which they belong. This hypothesis is more realistic compared to the assumption made in the majority of of top-down models where energy consumption is usually directly related to income through a nested structure of utility function.   --> production and consumption structures are represented with a generalized CES function which allows for the elasticity of substitution to differ between each couple of inputs or goods.  This is an improvement compared to the standard approach that uses nested CES functions which has the disadvantage to impose a common elasticity of substitution between the goods located in two different nested structures. <br>
</p>
<p>Compared to the previous version of the model<!-- (Callonnec et al., 2011; Reynes et al. 2011) -->, the following important improvements were made:
<li>The 4 energy sectors of the previous version (coal, petroleum, electricity and gas) have been subdivided into 13 sectors in order to better account for the impact of renewable energy.</li><br>
<li> The model now distinguishes commodities from activities: the number of activities is not equal to the number of commodities and each activity can potentially produce any commodity. This is typically the case for energy sectors that may produce the same commodity.  For instance, the commodity electricity is produced by several activities: nuclear, wind, solar, etc. Another example is the activity agriculture that produces several commodities: agriculture product, food, biofuel and biogas. </li><br>
<li>Because of access restrictions to National account investment data, investment decisions were modeled for all of the private sector. We now use detailed investment data disaggregated by sector and therefore identify a specific investment pattern for each activity.</li><br>
<li> The modeling of households' behaviors has been improved. The number of households has increased from 1 to 5, classified by quantile of revenue. In the previous version, only 2 energy classes (efficient and other) for buildings and cars were distinguished. The new verison includes 7 energy classes for buildings and cars that follows the standard A to G classification. The link between energy consumption and stock was rather <i>ad hoc</i>, since we assumed a loglinear negative correlation between energy consumption and the share of the efficient stock. The level of energy consumption (and thus of CO2 emissions) is now directly related to the type of buildings or cars and is also expressed in physical units. Finally, the arbitrage between the different classes of investments is not directly a function of price of energy, but of the relative user cost of each investment which includes the expected energy related costs.</li><br>

Three-ME model is programmed on the E-views 7 package software and simulated with 
the Broyden algorithm. <br>

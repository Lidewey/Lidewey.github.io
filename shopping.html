<h3>Centre Beaugrenelle Paris</h3>
<p>The newest of Paris's shopping centers, Beaugrenelle Paris offers the sort of shopping mall-like experience you know and love back home. It's about a 15 minute walk west of the Eiffel Tower, so away from the city center. But it conveniently sits right next to the river bank (quai) so no worries you'd walk past and miss it. The shopping mall is divided into three separate buildings with the Panoramique building the one that houses Marks & Spencer. It's a three-storey building, this one, and its upper floor restaurants, like the hip Bermuda Onion, offer gorgeous views out onto the Seine and overlook the Maison de la Radio France. There's also a Chipotle on this side, one of the few in the city. The ground floor is a Pathé cinema mutli-plex. Other shops you can find here at Beaugrenelle are FNAC, Hollister, Aubade, Lacoste, Mango, Café Coton... and more. </p>

<h3>La Galerie du Carrousel du Louvre</h3>
<p>Surely only the French are audacious enough to put an indoor shopping mall underneath the world's most famous and revered museum. Nevermind that the Louvre was once home to kings and queens, it is now still home to Mona (Lisa) and Venus (de Milo). That aside, this is one of the loveliest shopping malls, and certainly the most conveniently located one, in Paris. Last year the luxury department store, Au Printemps, opened up a new location at the Carrousel to much fanfare. Among the boutiques you can find here are a Fragonard perfume shop, Lalique, Nature et Découverte and Yellow Korner, which is a chain store of high-end frameable art photos. The Point WC -- privately run public toilets - here is also convenient and clean. There is actually even a food court here, too. It offers a dozen or more choices and seating for hundreds. </p>

<h3>Village Royal</h3>
<p>This is by no means a shopping mecca, but rather a secret garden shopping experience. Baby Dior and Chanel are sure to get your attention immediately, but the other shops, such as the fairly new hair color bar, Bar des Coloristes, at the opposite end speak to a lady's soul. (They whip up tailor-made hair color potions, with or without ammonia, after a thorough consultation and analysis of your hair). Guy Degrenne is another of my favorite shops here. If you have a soft spot for dishware, cutlery, candlestick holders, crystal ware and other kitchen essentials, you can easily be completely unaware of the time slipping by while browsing in there. Of course, the middle part of this petite outdoor, secluded shopping arcade is dominated by a lovely café that offers welcoming tables and chairs at which to sit and enjoy a light meal, or a conversation, or both.</p>

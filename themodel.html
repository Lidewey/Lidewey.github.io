The overall structure of the model is schematized in <i><a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a></i>. In the short term, Three-ME has the main characteristics of a standard neo-Keynesian macroeconomic model of 
demand in an open economy. An important one is that demand determines supply. The 
demand is composed of (intermediate and final) consumption, investment and export whereas 
the supply comes from imports and the domestic production. As a feed-back with eventually 
some lags, the supply affects the demand through several mechanisms. The level of 
production determines the quantity of inputs used by the firms and thus the quantity of their 
intermediate consumptions and investment which are two components of the demand. It 
determines the level of employment as well and consequently the households’ final 
consumption. Another effect of employment on demand goes through the wage setting via the 
unemployment rate which is also determined by the active population. The active population 
is mainly determined by exogenous factors such as the demography but also by endogenous 
factors: because of discouraged worker effects, the unemployment rate may affect the labor 
participation rate and thus the active population.</p><br>

<p>The unemployment rate is an important determinant of the wages dynamic which is 
defined by a Phillips curve. The inflationary property of the model is determined by the 
feedback loop between wages, production cost and prices. Prices are assumed to adjust slowly 
to their optimum level that corresponds to a mark-up over marginal costs. Consequently, 
wages, which affect production costs, affect directly prices. Prices have in return an impact on 
wages because of they are indexed on the consumer price. Production costs are also directly 
affected by prices via the cost of intermediate consumptions and of investment. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This dynamic between wages, cost and prices affects the demand through several 
canals. Wages affect the household consumption because they are an important part of their 
income. Prices and cost affect profits and thus sectors’ debts level. But they affect the 
households’ consumption and investment too because they finance a part of the private debt 
of the economy. Another canal is the monetary policy which is defined by a Taylor rule. The 
European central bank determines the interest rate level based on the European level of 
inflation and unemployment. This has an effect on the demand via the negative effect of the 
real interest rate on consumption and investment. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The dynamic of prices is the driver of the substitution mechanisms of the model. The 
evolution of relative prices between imported and domestic goods defines the repartition 
between imported and domestic products to satisfy the internal (consumption and 
investments) and external (export) demand. The evolution of relative prices between types of 
goods and services defines the structure of consumption of the economy. Importantly for the 
analysis of environmental and energy policies, it defines the share of each energy and 
transport into (intermediate and final) consumptions. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Three-ME explicitly distinguishes between five types of transports and four types of 
energy (resp. red and yellow lines in <i><a href="#Table1">Table 1</a></i>). Energy intensity was the main criterion for the 
selection of the 24 sectors <!-- (see Appendix C) -->. This relatively high level of disaggregation is 
important to capture the complexity of the substitution mechanisms involved after a change in 
the relative price between energies. For instance, an increase in the oil price tends to lead to 
substitution from oil to the other energy in several ways. In addition to direct substitutions by 
producer and consumer, indirect effects occur via the increase of the production price of oil 
intensive sectors. This leads to intermediate and final consumptions structure less oil 
intensive. The decrease of the use of transport by road would be the most typical example.</p><br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Three-ME also accounts for endogenous energy efficiency and sobriety effects. In 
contrast with the substitution mechanisms, the reduction of a given energy consumption does 
not imply the increase of the use of another energy. Sobriety consists in refraining from 
consuming energy by for instance staying home during the weekend instead of taking the car 
or by lowering the heating temperature in the house. In general, sobriety leads to a decrease in 
the welfare of the consumer. In contrast, in the case of efficiency, the same welfare is 
achieved with a lower quantity of energy. Energy efficiency implies an investment in a more 
efficient technology by for instance switching from a high to a low oil consumption car or by 
using more efficient insulation techniques for the house. In the current version of model, endogenous efficiency phenomena are introduced through an explicit distinction between two 
types of housing and automobile investments: energy saving housing and “comfort” housing 
investments; low and high oil consumption cars.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In Three-ME, efficiency and sobriety phenomena decrease the consumer price since the 
share of energy into consumption decreases <!-- (see Section V ) -->. This allows for directly 9
capturing the so-called “rebound effect” in consumption behaviour often observed at the 
micro level (Bentzen, 2004; Sorrell and al., 2009). There is a rebound effect when the 
effective energy saving from an investment in energy efficiency is less than the energy saving 
expected ex ante because the consumer uses a part of the reduction of her energy bill to 
increase her energy consumption. A typical example is the case of certain poor households 
who live in badly insulated houses and set a low heating temperature to reduce their energy 
bill. After an insulation investment, they will have the tendency to increase the heating 
temperature of their house keeping their energy bill more or less constant. This effect is 
explicitly taken into account in the model: an energy efficiency investment decreases the 
consumer price and thus increases the real income which leads to a higher level of (energy) 
consumption. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The short and medium run dynamic is largely driven by the demand side through multiplier 
and accelerator mechanisms. Because of the slow adjustment of price and quantity to their 
optimal value, the allocation of production factors is sub-optimal in the short and medium run. 
The long term is driven by the supply constrain. All adjustment processes are achieved: there 
is no error of anticipation and the effective quantities coincide with the optimal ones. The 
prices are fully adjusted and all markets are in equilibrium. The unemployment reaches its 
structural level. The economy thus converges toward a stable equilibrium growth path à la 
Solow (1956) where all real variables grow at the same rate defined as the sum of the growth 
rates of the technical progress and of the population. Per capita real variables grow thus at the 
same rate as the technical progress. All prices grow at the rate of inflation which is defined by 
the exogenous rate of inflation in the rest of the world. The endogenous dynamic of the model 
is determined by capital accumulation of households and firms, the specification of the 
anticipation and of the adjustment dynamic. <br>
